# AWS IoT Webinar - Using AWS IoT for Authenticating External Services

## Welcome

Welcome to the CyberArk AWS IoT Webinar. 
below you will find general description, links and most importantly, step-by-step which you can follow to recreate everything we did during the webinar. 
I hope you enjoy the webinar and if you have any questions feel free to open an issue here or DM me @RoyBenYosefTM on twitter.

ðŸ’µðŸ’µ **DISCLAIMER 1:** ðŸ’µðŸ’µ

Using AWS costs money. while the things we do here may or may not be under the free tier (and even if not, they are very low volume), 
you are responsible for the costs and the resources you create and to clean up after yourself.
A Cleanup section is provided at the bottom, but it many contain mistakes, os make sure you clean up what you did after it is no longer needed and bear in mind the costs

As webinars go, some of the settings here were simplified. when it come to production systems and code, you are responsible to do your own research and security review all parts including but not limited to IAM policies, IoT policies, certificates, S3 bucket settings and anything else that is mentioned here.
Consider this a webinar grade material and treat it as such.

Especially note all default role creation, in a real scenario, you must review and narrow down your policies to the absolute minimus needed.

## Intro

AWS IoT is a suite of services, designed to allow the provisioning and managing of IoT devices in a secure manner. It includes things like, provisioning, authentication, two-way communication, variety of SDKs, Groups, Monitoring, Analysis and much more.

## What Are We Going To Build?
We will use AWS IoT to allow our services which are external to AWS, access to our cloud platform and allow them to communicate with our backend securly. We will see that AWS IoT doesnt have to do with IoT neccessarily, because what is an IoT device if not a machine running Linux? (or windows, or whatever for that matter)

## The Scenario
We have a honeypot service deployed in our network. this service is supposed to lure attackers by exposing seemingly lucrative endpoints that appeal to attackers. for example RDP, SSH Servers, various databases and more. since these aren't real services, usually we wouldn't expect anyone to try to communicate with them, and so upon detecting such a connection attempt the canary service must inform us of this incident.

In our cloud platform, we run an audit service, and we would like the canary to report to it directly for each suspicious incident. To do this we much put in place secure authentication and authorization means, so the canary service can communicate with the backend securely.

We are going to use AWS IoT for this, since everything it provides can easily be used with any scenario and not necessarily with actual IoT devices.

But before we dive in, let's do a quick overview of the prominent services that AWS IoT has to offer.
